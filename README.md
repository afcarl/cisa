# ISA

A C++ implementation of overcomplete independent subspace analysis.

This code implements an efficient blocked Gibbs sampler for inference and maximum likelihood
learning in overcomplete linear models with sparse source distributions.

## Requirements

* NumPy >= 2.6.0
* automake >= 1.11.0
* libtool >= 2.4.0

I have tested it with the above versions, but older versions might also work.

## Installation

### Linux

Go to `./code/liblbfgs` and execute the following:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-sse2
	make

Once the L-BFGS library is compiled, go back to the root directory and execute:

	python setup.py build

### Mac OS X

First, make sure you have recent versions of automake and libtool installed. The versions that come
with Xcode 4.3 didn't work for me. You can use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install
newer ones.

	brew install autoconf automake libtool
	brew link autoconf automake libtool

Next, go to `./code/liblbfgs` and execute the following:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-sse2
	make CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch i386"

Once the L-BFGS library is compiled, go back to the root directory and execute:

	python setup.py build
